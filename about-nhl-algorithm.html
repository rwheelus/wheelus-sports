            <h1>About the NHL Algorithm</h1>
    
            <p>The <strong>NHL Algorithm</strong> scores teams based on opponent strength, margin of victory, and whether the game was played at home or on the road. Each game produces a performance score for both teams based on those inputs. A team's rating is the average of all of those game values. The calculation is then iterated through until a steady state is found and each team’s rating changes by less than 1e-7.</p>
    
            <h2>Table Glossary</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Rank:</strong> The team’s actual ranking</li>
                <li><strong>Team:</strong> The team’s name</li>
                <li><strong>Rating:</strong> The team’s rating using the system described above</li>
                <li><strong>Overall Record:</strong> The team’s record across all games played in the season</li>
                <li><strong>Regular Season:</strong> The team’s record for Regular Season games</li>
                <li><strong>Post Season:</strong> The team’s record for Post Season games</li>
                <li><strong>OT Record:</strong> The team’s record in games that went into overtime</li>
                <li><strong>Shootout Record:</strong> The team’s record in games that went into shootouts</li>
                <li><strong>OT Period Record:</strong> The team’s record in overtime where each non-shootout overtime period is considered separately. For example, if a team wins in 3OT, they would have naturally drawn the first two overtime periods and won the third, so their record would be 1-0-2 (1 win, 0 losses, 2 draws).</li>
                <li><strong>Offensive Goals/G:</strong> How many goals per game the team scores (excl. shootout goals)</li>
                <li><strong>Defensive Goals/G:</strong> How many goals per game the team gives up (excl. shootout goals)</li>
            </ul>
